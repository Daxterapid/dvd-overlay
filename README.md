Bouncing DVD Logo Overlay

## Building

### Windows
Make sure MinGW and GLFW 3.4 (unstable) are installed on your system, then run:
```
make
```

### Linux
**Though untested, it's likely this only works with certain window managers.**

You'll probably have to install GLFW 3.4 (unstable) and run `make`.

---

*GLFW 3.4 is required for input passthrough.*

## Running

### Windows
```
build\dvd_overlay.exe
```
